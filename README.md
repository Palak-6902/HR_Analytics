## Dashboard Insights

* Attrition by Gender: Higher attrition observed among males.
* Attrition by Age Group: The 26–35 age group shows the highest attrition rate.
* Attrition by Salary Slab: Most attrition occurs among employees earning up to 5K.
* Attrition by Education: Employees with Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds form the majority of attrition cases.
* Attrition by Years at Company: Attrition peaks during the first year of employment and again shows a rise around the 10-year mark, indicating challenges both in early retention and long-term engagement.

## Recommendations

* Enhance Early Engagement Programs: Since attrition peaks within the first year, onboarding and mentorship programs should be strengthened to help new employees adjust effectively.
* Salary Structure Review: A significant portion of attrition occurs among employees earning below 5000. Competitive compensation adjustments and incentive-based pay structures can help improve retention.
* Career Growth Opportunities: The 26–35 age group shows the highest attrition, often due to career stagnation. Offering structured growth paths and training programs can encourage long-term association.
* Long-term Engagement Strategies: The rise in attrition after 10 years suggests the need for re-engagement initiatives such as leadership development, rotational assignments, or loyalty rewards.
* Gender Balance Initiatives: As male attrition is higher, analyzing workload, work-life balance, and departmental factors may reveal actionable improvements.
